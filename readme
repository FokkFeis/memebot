This is a small meme bot for discord, written in python 3.6 using discord.py
As such, it requires discord.py to be installed; to install, simply run isntall deps.bat or deps.sh
If you get an aiohttp error citing an unclosed client session, simply run resetaio.bat or resetaio.sh depending on your operating system.
